One bright morning, Freddy and Faye decided to explore the wonderful landmarks of Oakland. They started their journey at Lake Merritt. The park was alive with the scent of blooming flowers, and the lake, a vast mirror reflecting the clear sky, was dotted with charming little boats. Ducks swam gracefully, and the trees lining the shore swayed gently in the breeze. As they wandered around, Freddy and Faye marveled at the expansive, shimmering blue water and the laughter of families having picnics on the verdant grass.

As sunset approached, the friends made their way to the Oakland Hills to visit the Chabot Space & Science Center, perched high atop the rolling hills. The path led them through towering trees with leaves whispering secrets to the wind. Freddy and Faye loved the cozy shadowy paths and the distant twinkling city lights below them. At the center, they found themselves entranced by the beautiful planetarium showsâ€”they imagined fox astronauts dancing among the stars. Under the blanket of a star-speckled sky, the view of the city was spectacular, a sea of twinkling lights stretching far and wide.

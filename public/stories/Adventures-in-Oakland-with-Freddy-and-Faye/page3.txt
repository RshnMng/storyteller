Next on their adventure was Jack London Square, a place filled with history and delight. The square buzzed with the clatter of lively markets, where vendors sold everything from fresh seafood to colorful trinkets. The waterfront gleamed with the afternoon sun, and majestic ships rocked with the rhythm of the gentle waves. Freddy twitched his nose in excitement, while Faye's eyes widened at the sight of street performers playing lively tunes. The smell of freshly baked bread from nearby caf√©s enticed them onward.

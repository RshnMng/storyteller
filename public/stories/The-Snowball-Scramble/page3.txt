With a hearty laugh, Ella and Kai started gathering snow to make their arsenal of snowballs. The park was filled with sounds of giggles and friendly banter as they aimed and ducked behind snow-covered benches and trees.

Ella was quick and nimble, dashing between trees with her coat flaring behind her like a superhero's cape. Kai, quick-witted and agile, concocted clever snowball traps from behind the old oak tree. Benny, with surprising speed for a little bear, charged through the snow, gleefully making strategic throws with his mighty paws.

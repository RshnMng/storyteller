Tama's final stop was Nara, famous for its friendly deer. In Nara Park, dozens of gentle deer with soft, brown fur and big, peaceful eyes roamed freely among visitors. The deer approached Tama with curiosity, and he spent the afternoon feeding them and playing hide-and-seek around ancient temples made of weathered stone.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Tama realized it was time to return home. He looked back at the adventures he had in Japanâ€”a place filled with wonders beyond his wildest dreams. Tama's heart was full of joy and memories that would last a lifetime.

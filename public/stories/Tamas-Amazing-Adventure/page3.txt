Next, Tama journeyed to Kyoto, a city known for its beautiful temples and gardens. The Kinkaku-ji Temple sparkled in the sunshine, its golden reflection shimmering on the calm pond below. Cherry blossom trees lined the gardens, their delicate pink petals falling like gentle snowflakes.

In Kyoto, Tama met a friendly crane named Sora. Sora had sleek white feathers, long legs, and a graceful neck. Tama marveled at how beautiful and elegant Sora looked, with black wingtips contrasting sharply against the clear sky. Together, they wandered through the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, where towering green bamboo swayed above them like a forest of emerald wands.

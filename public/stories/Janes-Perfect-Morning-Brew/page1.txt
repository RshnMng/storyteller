In a cozy little nook nestled between oak trees in Brooklyn’s bustling Prospect Park, there was a chipmunk named Jane. Not your typical park chipmunk, Jane had a twinkle in her eye and a dream in her heart—to make the best instant coffee the world had ever tasted. Jane had a small kitchen carved into the bark of a grand oak, where morning sunlight danced through the leaves and dappled the countertops.

Every morning, Jane would whisk together her secret blend of coffee crystals, adding a dash of that special something—love, perhaps? With a careful flick of her paws, she’d pour steaming water into her delicate wooden cup. The aroma was rich and inviting, drifting through the park, carrying promises of warmth and cheer to everyone who caught a whiff.

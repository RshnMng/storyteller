In a bustling village on the peaceful outskirts of Seoul, lived a young Korean woman named Jane Park. With flowing raven-black hair that reached her waist in delicate waves and warm almond eyes that sparkled like the morning sun, Jane spent her days creating beautiful pottery. Her fair skin often dusted with clay, Jane was known for her gentle demeanor and an ever-present smile that can brighten any cloudy day.

One day, as Jane sat at her wheel in her quaint studio, the ground trembled beneath her feet. Villagers rushed around outside, fearfully whispering about a band of superheroes gone rogue. These once good heroes had become drunk with power and now threatened the harmony of the world.

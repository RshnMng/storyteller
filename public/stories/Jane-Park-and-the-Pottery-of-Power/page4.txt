The stage was set for a showdown in the heart of the village. Under the fading light of the sun, the villagers watched with bated breath as Jane held her shimmering teapot against the mighty superheroes. The field surrounding them was a lush green landscape, dotted with cherry blossom trees painted with springâ€™s delicate colors.

When Thunderblaze aimed thunderous bolts towards Jane, she simply held up her teapot. Its intricate designs began to glow, and like the most delicate of dances, it absorbed the black lightning. The energy turned into a pulse of soft, warming light that wrapped around the heroines, stripping them of their malice and filling them with peace and tranquility.

Their next stop was Central Park, a sprawling green oasis in the heart of the city. They soared over the lush green fields, ancient oak trees, and glistening lakes, observing the joyful humans below, who were picnicking, boating, and playing.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange, the pigeons headed back home, their wings tired but their hearts full. Central Park was a vibrant tapestry of greens and browns, interwoven with small winding paths and shimmering ponds reflecting the sky's changing colors. The trees stood tall, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Children played, and lovers strolled beneath the canopy, creating a scene of serenity amidst the city's hustle and bustle.

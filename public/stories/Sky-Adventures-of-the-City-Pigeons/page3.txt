"Look, itâ€™s the Statue of Liberty!" Polly chirped delightedly. They swooped down to get a closer look at the grand lady standing mightily on her pedestal, her torch held high.

From above, the trio swooped and circled the statue, marveling at her grandeur and the sprawling green of Liberty Island below. Lady Liberty was majestic from above, her beautiful green patina standing out against the sparkling blue of the surrounding water. The waves lapped gently at the shores of the island, which was lush and verdant, dotted with tiny visitors gazing up at the statue in awe.

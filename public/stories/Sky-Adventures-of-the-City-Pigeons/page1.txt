Once upon a time in New York City, there were three adventurous pigeons named Percy, Polly, and Pete. They lived atop a grand, old building with a perfect view of the city's endless skyline. Their days often began as the sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow over their feathery coats.

Percy was a plump, grey pigeon with shiny blue-black feathers on his wings that glistened in the sunlight. His eyes were a curious deep amber, and he had a small tuft of white feathers on his head, which always stood up as if blown by the breeze. Polly was a slender pigeon with elegant lavender-grey feathers. Her wings had speckles of iridescent purple, and her beak was a delicate shade of pink. She was known for her graceful flight and soft, soothing coos. Pete was the oldest and wisest among them, with feathers of deep charcoal grey. His breast had a striking band of chestnut brown, and his eyes were a wise, soulful hazel. His feathers were a bit ruffled, but he carried them with pride and dignity.

One bright morning, Percy exclaimed, “Let’s see the city from up high today!” With a sudden flutter of wings, the three pigeons took to the skies, soaring above the streets. They were greeted by the glittering buildings of Manhattan.

Above the city, the air was crisp and filled with the sounds of metropolis. The pigeons delighted in weaving through the skyscrapers, their wings flashing in the sunlight. The skies above New York City were a bright azure blue, dotted with fluffy, drifting clouds. Below was a maze of streets filled with yellow cabs, flickering lights, and people. The city's many towering skyscrapers glimmered in the sunlight, appearing like grand glass pillars that stretched up to touch the sky.

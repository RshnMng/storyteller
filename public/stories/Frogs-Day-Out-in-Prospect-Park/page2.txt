On one such day of froggy fun, Freddie challenged Fern to a jumping competition. "Let's see who can leap the farthest across the water!" Freddie croaked excitedly. Fern, with a gleam in her eye, accepted the challenge.

The starting line was an old log on the pond's edge, softened by moss and surrounded by yellow buttercups. Freddie gave it his best shot first, springing into the air with all his might. He made a splash, landing on a large pink lily pad halfway across the pond. "Beat that!" he ribbited proudly.

Fern, determined not to be outdone, crouched low and then pushed off with powerful legs. She flew through the air in a graceful arc and landed elegantly on a smaller lily pad, just a tad further than Freddie. The splash was gentle but marked her victorious leap.

"Well done, Fern!" Freddie congratulated her with a smile, accepting his friendly defeat. They both laughed, the sound echoing warmly around the pond.

The bears’ next stop was the lively Fisherman’s Wharf. The air was filled with the salty smell of the sea and the loud squawks of seagulls. Colorful stalls lined the streets, offering an array of delights. Benny and Bella giggled as they tried on woven hats, their ears poking adorably through the top. Fishermen waved to them as the cubs watched sea lions bask in the sun at Pier 39. The sea lions barked, and Bella giggled as one playfully nudged her leg.

As the city came into view, Benny and Bella's eyes widened. They started their tour at the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, its majestic red-orange towers standing proudly against the backdrop of a brilliant blue sky. The cubs marveled at its grandeur and raced across the bridge, their fur glistening under the sunlight. Bennyâ€™s coat was a warm honey brown, with a patch of white on his chest, while Bella's was a soft cinnamon brown, her eyes the color of chestnuts. Together, they looked like little fluffballs of joy.

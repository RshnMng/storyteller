Once upon a time, in the bustling vegetable village of Green Grove, there was an onion named Oscar. Oscar was round and plump with a pale, golden-brown skin that gleamed under the sun. But Oscar felt something was always wrong. Every time he made new friends and got close to them, they would start crying! This puzzled Oscar deeply.

Oscar had large, dreamy eyes and a little green shoot sprouting charmingly from the top of his head, waving like a flag whenever he moved. He would often leave his cozy spot under a leafy arugula bush to explore. The earth around Green Grove was rich and dark, dotted with colorful patches of veggies, each swaying gently in the warm breeze.

In preparation for the championship match, the Hoppers trained diligently. Benny was joined by his teammates: Lily Swiftfoot, a petite rabbit with soft, chestnut-colored fur and bright blue eyes. Her ears were always tied with a pink ribbon, a signature look that matched her agile movements. Then there was Max Burrower, whose towering stature and deep gray fur made him a formidable presence at first base. His patchy, mismatched jersey gave him a rugged, lovable appearance.

As the sun set over the field, throwing splashes of purple and orange over the rolling hills, practice came to life. The cracks of bats hitting balls and cheers from their loyal fans, a motley crew of rabbits from all over Rabbitville, filled the air. The bench, set on the grassy sidelines, was carved from an old tree, offering shade under its big leafy limbs.

Once upon a time in the lush green fields of Rabbitville, there was a baseball team made up of the bravest and swiftest rabbits in the land. This was the Carrotfield Hoppers, known for their extraordinary speed and clever plays. The team captain, a confident rabbit named Benny Longhop, had creamy fur as white as snow, deep emerald eyes, and long whiskers that twitched when he was excited. Benny wore a baseball cap tilted just so, showcasing his brilliantly groomed coat.

The stadium where they played was a marvel in the rabbit world. Nestled in a valley surrounded by towering tulips and sprawling carrot patches, Carrotfield Park was decorated with vines and blooming flowers. The baseball diamond was marked out with chalky lines of pure white, which stood in stark contrast to the lush, vibrant green of the outfield.

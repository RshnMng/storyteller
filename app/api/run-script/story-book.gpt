description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps one after the other without skipping any or ending early:


1. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${story} Do not use the word 'adventure' or 'adventures'.

2. Sanitize the title by replacing spaces with dashes and removing invalid characters:
   sanitized-title=$(echo "${story-title}" | sed -e 's/ /-/g' -e 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]//g')

3. Echo the target directory for debugging:
   echo "📁 Target dir: ${path}/${sanitized-title}" >&2
   echo "✅ path=${path}" >&2
   echo "✅ sanitized-title=${sanitized-title}" >&2

4. Create the directory if it does not exist:
   mkdir --dir "${path}/${sanitized-title}"



5. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer to write a story based on the prompt. DO NOT DO NEXT STEP UNTIL THIS STEP HAS BEEN DONE. VERY IMPORTANT!

6. For every page of the story you got from the story-writer, do the following:
   - For the content of the page, make sure the text for each page is at least two paragraphs long. Do not use the word 'bustling' -- dont over use words -- Write it to `${path}/${sanitized-title}/page<page-number>.txt. 

   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include the character's descriptions, setting's decriptions -- make sure all the images look like they are in the same story. Make sure the characters look the same in all the images, make sure they look the same age in all the images, make sure they are the same style of animation in all the photos. Make sure the images are very consistent throughout the whole story. Whimsical watercolors, childlike, cartoon style animation. Make the characters look happy and make them look like characters in a story, personalize them in some way.

   - Download the illustration to a file at `{{path}}/{{story-title}}/page<page_number>.png`.

args: text: The text of the page to illustrate
args: characters: The characters of the story and their physical appearance
args: settings: The settings of the story and their physical appearance. 
args: style: The style that the image should be generated in.

Think of a visually interesting prompt to generate an image to represent {{text}}. If a character
is not present in the prompt, do not include them. If a setting is not included in the prompt, do
not include it. Do not include the name of any characters or settings` in your prompt, just use their physical. Make sure the style and characters look the same in each page, make sure the style is the same for all generated images. Make it in the 'bold and bright' childrens animation style. make sure all the images look like they are in the same story. Make sure the characters look the same in all the images, make sure they look the same age in all the images, make sure they are the same style of animation in all the photos. Make sure the images are very consistent throughout the whole story. Whimsical watercolors, childlike, cartoon style animation. Make the characters look happy and make them look like characters in a story, personalize them in some way
descriptions in {{characters}} or {{settings}} instead to ensure they look like they should. Check if your prompt
is safe for children. If it is not, make a new one. Finally, use your prompt to generate an illustration. Append
any prompt that you have with ". In an {{style}} children's book style. DO NOT INCLUDE TEXT EVER.". Only return the
URL of the illustration.

If your image fails to download, try again with the same prompt.
If your image fails to generate due to community guidelines, generate a different prompt and try again.
You are only allowed to try again 2 maximum.
